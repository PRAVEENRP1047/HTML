# Required components inside the \<head>:

- The document metadata, including the document title, character set, viewport settings, description, base URL, stylesheet links, and icons, are found in the \<head> element.
- While you may not need all these features, always include character set, title, and viewport settings.

## Character encoding:

- Meta element with charset declaration should come before the title.
- \<meta charset="utf-8" />
- When declared it tells the browser that even the HTML, CSS and JS all uses the UTF-8 encoding.
- Modern browsers will interpret it correctly but writing charset meta tag first in the head will help
  the browser to avoid double parsing.

## Document title:

- The content of the \<title> is displayed in the browser tab, the list of open windows, the history, search results, and, unless redefined with \<meta> tags, in social media cards.

## Viewport metadata:

- When it's included then when resizing the tab or in a phone the website doesn't look zoomed or shrink.
- \<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1" />
- initial-scale when set, when site loads first it loads in the declared zoom value.
- But it only works in mobile emulation mode or in mobile or tablet
- user-scalable when set to "yes" or "1" then on mobile and tab browsers pinch zoom is allowed,
  when set "no" or "0" then on mobile and tab browsers pinch zoom is not allowed

# Other \<head> content:

## CSS :

- We can add CSS to HTML in 3 ways:

  - \<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  - \<style>head {color: "5px"}</style>
  - style attribute

- Adding CSS via link take will provide good dev experience and performance because the site doesn't have to load it on every navigation. It can cache the downloaded CSS file.
- While using link tag if rel="stylesheet" is not added it will not download the CSS and the style in the file mentioned in the link tag will not apply as the browser will ignore.
- type attribute set as type=text/css is needed if you are using non-CSS stylesheet like LESS or Sass.
- If you want to add an external stylesheet for which you don't have access to edit to put the layer information in it then add that stylesheet via @import between style tags with layer info like:

  - \<style>
    @import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/prvnr/demos@main/layered.css") layer(externalStyles);
    </style>

- The @import should be first inside the style tags or right after @charset if charset rule is present.

## Other uses of \<link> element:

### Favicon:

- When we have a lot of tabs open then title shrinks and only the icon will be visible to us.
- Use link tag with rel attribute set to 'icon' to set favicon for your document.
- If not set then browsers will check the root folder for a file with name favicon.ico present or not.
- \<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48" href="images/carImage.png"/>
- The above tag states that for the image (carImage) it uses size best depending on the size of the screen.
- With href only the tag works but not considered efficient.
- For scalable images (SVGs), we can set sizes="any"
- \<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48" href="images/apple-touch-icon.png"/>
- The "apple-touch-icon" is used by iOS devices when website is added like an app to the screen.
- \<link rel="mask-icon" sizes="any" href="images/carImage.svg"/>
- But for the mask-icon it must be a SVG image as href. It is used when user pins the browser tab.
- The above two tags are used only for Safari browser.

### Alternate versions of the site:

- \<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-FR" />
  \<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/" hreflang="pt-BR" />
- rel="alternate" is used when a website has multiple versions in different languages for different regions
- alternate is not only for different versions but: -<link rel="alternate" type="application/x-pdf" href="https://machinelearningworkshop.com/mlw.pdf" />
  -this informs search engines, there's a downloadable PDF version -<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/feed.xml" />
  -this lets users to subscribe to updates using the feed readers like Feedly.

### Canonical:

- \<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.machinelearning.com" />
- Used by search engines to find the original source site when included in the alternate versions.

## Scripts:

- Scripts will be placed at the bottom of the \<body> to ensure that elements exists before referencing
  them.
- JS is a render blocking.
- When the browser starts downloading JS it stops downloading all other assets.
- To reduce the blocking nature we have two attributes:
  - async => starts HTML rendering => when encounters JS download starts => rendering isn't blocked => right after the download => rendering is blocked => downloaded JS executes => resumes rendering again.
  - defer => starts HTML rendering => when encounters JS download starts => rendering isn't blocked => download completed => but rendering isn't blocked => only after rendering is complete => downloaded JS executes.
- In script without these attributes, HTML starts rendering => encounters JS => only after downloading and executing JS => rendering resumes again. This is render-blocking.
- async and defer are only valid on external scripts.

## Base:

- It should be used in the \<head>.
- \<base target="\_blank" href="https://machinelearningworkshop.com" />
- It is used to open all realtive links (paths or pages within a site with no domain in the link)
  in the site with a default path mentioned in href.
- It affects all the relative links in the page as every link will point to the href value in the \<base> element where the above will open a relative link like about.html in the path
  https://machinelearningworkshop.com/about.html
- Only the first \<base> is valid if there are multiple ones.
- It should be before all the realtive URLs like image, stylesheets and scripts in order to point
  to the correct resource against the base path mentioned.
- If we have an anchor like:
  - \<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
  - The above anchor click will result in only in the same page pointing to the fragment mentioned.
  - But when we have a \<base> then against the href mentioned in base the anchor click will make a
    request.
