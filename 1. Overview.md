# Tags are implied:

- \<ul>
  \<li>Blendan Smooth
  \<li>Hoover Sukhdeep
  \<li>Toasty McToastface
  \</ul>
- Even if we forgot to include the closing tags of the \<li> they are implied.

# Quirks Mode Vs Standard Mode:

- When \<!DOCTYPE html> declaration is missing then, the document enters the quirks mode. In this
  mode, browsers chooses legacy rendering in which box model is different (Eg. width includes the
  border , padding also).

- The opposite is standard mode, in which the width doesn't include the padding and border.

- We can check the mode by document.compatMode in console. If the value is 'CSS1Compat' then the
  document is said to be in the standard mode. If the value is 'BackCompat' then the document is said to be in the quirks mode.

# Non-replaced Elements:

- These are elements whose content is determined by the content between the tags.
- (Eg.) \<p>, \<h1>, \<div>

# Replaced Elements:

- These are elements whose content is determined by an external resource (like an image for \<img>) or the browser.
- (Eg.) \<img>, \<input>
- Most replaced elements are void elements but not all of them.
- The video, picture, object, and iframe elements are replaced, but aren't void. They can all contain other elements or text, so they all have a closing tag.
- Most void elements are replaced but not all of them.
- link and meta tag can't have any content but they're there to provide informations via it's attributes.

# Attributes:

- They provide info about the element.
- Attributes will not appear in the content but it will help us to define how the element would appear to both sighted and non-sighted users.
- HTML tags are case-insensitive.
- Attribute names are case-insensitive.
- Some attribute values are case-sensitive. The attributes that are declared in the specification along with the standard values are case-insensitive. The attribute values that are user defined like 'id' , 'class' are case-sensitive.
